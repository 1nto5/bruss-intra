# TODO

- [ ] Individual Overtime Orders + Overtime Orders: add export functionality for each order (similar to deviations)
- [ ] IT Inventory: display notes column in main inventory table
- [ ] IT Inventory: fix edit functionality - save button does nothing when clicked
- [ ] IT Inventory: fix back button in edit form - should return to details page, not main page
- [ ] IT Inventory: add multiselect filter for employee search
- [ ] IT Inventory: persist selected filters during navigation (restore filters when returning to list)
- [ ] Individual Overtime Orders config: rename the collection and set actual hour limits for each supervisor in both Overtime Submissions and Individual Overtime Orders applications
- [ ] Remove old production-overtime app files: delete `app/[lang]/production-overtime/` directory and `app/api/production-overtime/` routes (proxy redirect is already in place, migration is complete)
