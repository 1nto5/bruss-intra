# TODO

## Overtime Submissions

- [s] Add "correct entry" option to Actions column in employee detail view
- [ ] Allow line managers to give final approval for payment requests within assigned monthly limit (currently they only do first approval, then goes to plant manager)
- [ ] Send 7-day end-of-month balance reminder to both employee AND their line manager (currently only employee gets notified)
- [ ] Display day of week alongside overtime dates (localized to current language)

## Database

- [ ] Add MongoDB indexes for Overtime Orders, Overtime Submissions, and Individual Overtimes collections

## UI/UX

- [ ] Fix bulk action dialog spacing - confirmation button too close to table rows
